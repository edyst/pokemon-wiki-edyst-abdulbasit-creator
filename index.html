                      created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
                      Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
                      after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
                      Green version was not released outside Japan
